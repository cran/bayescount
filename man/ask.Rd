\title{OBTAIN INPUT FROM USER WITH ERROR HANDLING}
\description{
   A simple function to detect input from the user, and keep prompting until a response matching the class of input required is given.  Used by the function 'bayescount'.
}
\usage{
ask(prompt="?", type="logical", bounds=c(-Inf, Inf), na.allow=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
   \item{prompt}{what text string should be used to prompt the user? (character string)}
   \item{type}{the class of object expected to be returned - "logical", "numeric", "integer", "character".  If the user input does not match this return, the prompt is repeated}
   \item{bounds}{the lower and upper bounds of number to be returned.  Ignored if type is "logical" or "character"}
   \item{na.allow}{if TRUE, allows the user to input "NA" for any type, which is returned as NA}
